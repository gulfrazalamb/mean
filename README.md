User Manual: Bash Tool for Calculating Mean of Numbers

Overview:
This tool is a Bash script that calculates the mean of a list of numbers provided by the user. It takes a comma-separated list of numbers as input and returns the mean of those numbers as output.

Usage:

    1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the Bash script is saved.
    2. Run the following command to make the script executable: chmod +x script_name.sh
    3. Run the script using the following command: ./script_name.sh
    4. Enter a comma-separated list of numbers when prompted by the script.

Functionality:

    1. The script prompts the user to enter a comma-separated list of numbers.
    2. The script splits the input string into an array using ',' as the delimiter.
    3. The script calculates the sum of the numbers using a for loop.
    4. The script calculates the mean of the numbers using the sum and the length of the array.
    5. The script outputs the mean of the numbers to the terminal.

Tips:

    * The script only accepts comma-separated numbers as input.
    * Make sure to enter the numbers correctly, as any non-numeric input will result in an error.
    * If the input contains decimals, make sure to use a '.' as the decimal separator.

Example:
Suppose you want to calculate the mean of the following list of numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

    1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where the Bash script is saved.
    2. Run the following command to make the script executable: chmod +x script_name.sh
    3. Run the script using the following command: ./script_name.sh
    4. Enter the following comma-separated list of numbers when prompted by the script: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    5. The script will output the mean of the numbers, which is 3.00.

Note: This tool is open-source and can be modified or extended as per your requirement.
